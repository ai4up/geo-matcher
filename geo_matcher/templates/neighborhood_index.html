    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Building Footprint Matching Tool!</h2>
    <p>This mode presents you with entire neighborhoods, where all presumed matching building pairs have been pre-connected by green edges. Your task is to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remove</strong> incorrect matches by clicking on their connecting lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> missing matches by clicking on one building from each dataset â€” in any order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take a moment to explore the functionality in this demo before getting started with the real data.</p>
    <p>Once you've reviewed the neighborhood and are confident in your changes, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button to save your labels and continue.</p>
